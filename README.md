# Adaptive Finite Volume Method Toolbox

This is a toolbox to test the adaptive finite volume discretization written with the companion paper ([Ahn 2019](https://sehyoun.com/adaptive_finite_volume/zrefs.html#ahn2018adaptive)). For a more detailed description see the [documentation and tutorials](https://sehyoun.com/adaptive_finite_volume).
